# ethTax
This project is dedicated towards building a general taxing framework that will work on transactions in the Ethereum Blockchain. The reason why it must be general is because taxing agencies need to be able to fork this project, while allowing the companies that comply with those taxing agencies to maintain the same relationship with any other taxing agency.
